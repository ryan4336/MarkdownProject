# Skiing
The first and only time I have been skiing was over winter break last year (2023). My friends and I (7 of us total) took two cars and drove down to Breckenridge, Colorado, where we all stayed in one hotel room for three days of skiing. Here is an image of the bottom/beginning of the slopes. ![Image of slopes; Breckenridge, Colorado](https://d3glb5zioac6h9.cloudfront.net/uploads/sources/297281/detail_large/Screen_Shot_2019-07-23_at_4.21.43_PM.jpg?1663365428)
## The Hotel Room Experience
Staying in a single hotel room with six other people was definitely an experience.
It wasn't necessarily a bad one, although it was hard to sleep (for me at least) because of the two **loud breathers** we had in the room with us.
## Learning to Ski
Like I said, this was my first time skiing ever, and the first day was rough. It was fun but also frustrating. However, on the second day, I really started to pick it up fast, and before I knew it I was cruising down blue slopes (although I did fall many times).
In the end, I had a lot of fun and it was way easier to pick up than I though. I hope to be able to go again sometime soon.
